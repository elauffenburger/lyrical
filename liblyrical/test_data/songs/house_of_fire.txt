I'm gonna play the real life
I'm gonna do my best to survive
Really the best
To keep the fire into my heart

'Cause I wanna be free in the sky tonight
I don't wanna hear from you all more lies
I know I will be your star
When we'll reach to the sky
I fly now

Welcome to the house of fire
Let me go - let me go
I just wanna let you go
Take me to the house of fire
Wanna spend all my life time

Welcome to the house of fire
Let me go - let me go
I just wanna let you go
Take me to the house of fire
Wanna spend all my life time

The satellite is on me now
Now, I can see the rays of fire
Stay by my side
Until the end of your silence

'Cause I wanna be free in the sky tonight
I don't wanna hear from you all more lies
I know I will be your star
When we'll reach to the sky
I fly now

Welcome to the house of fire
Let me go - let me go
I just wanna let you go
Take me to the house of fire
Wanna spend all my life time

Welcome to the house of fire
Let me go - let me go
I just wanna let you go
Take me to the house of fire
Wanna spend all my life time

The satellite is on me now
Now, I can see the rays of fire
Stay by my side
Until the end of your silence
